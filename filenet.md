#IBM FileNet Knowledge Collections
## Local Group
local group is a new feature introduced since v5.5.7. the idea behind is external user repository is lack of dynamicity. hence FileNet provides another alternative to allow application to create FileNet-Managed groups (basically it's a federated repository from websphere perspective).
and allow application to use either ICN? or API to CRUD groups.
