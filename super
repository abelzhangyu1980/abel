# contributions
How super contributions are treated depends on whether they're before-tax (concessional) or after-tax (non-concessional).
the contributions are out of your before-tax or post-tax income
you exceed the concessional or non-concessional contribution caps
you're a high-income earner.

## concessional contributions
not yet been taxed ('before tax' contributions) – which are concessional contributions
Concessional contributions are taxed in your super fund at the rate of 15%, payable by the fund.
The concessional contributions cap is the maximum amount of before-tax contributions you can contribute to your super each year without contributions being subject to extra tax.
From 1 July 2024, the concessional contributions cap is $30,000.

一般来说打工人只能通过salary sacrifice来做concessional contributions。
另一种是after-tax的contribution。这也是占用了每年的concessional contribution的额度。需要通知super做tax reduction。
例子： 我给我的super存了10000块钱，并告知super做tax reduction。super就会收15%的tax。这样实际存到super的就只有8500块。等于是又被再次收税？
其实不是，super会告诉ATO说我contribution了1000块，ATO就会把这10000块从当财年的taxable收入里面减掉。
## non-concessional contributions
already been taxed ('after tax' contributions) – which are non-concessional contributions.
