# some general concepts:
## DTI - Debt to income ratio
银行衡量接待人的财务健康状况的一个重要指标是DTI，债务收入比。高DTI通常表明较高的财务压力，增加了接待人违约的风险。银行接受的DTI范围在6-7倍之间，甚至更低。
如何突破这个限制呢，用Trust。Trust去贷款的话，银行是不考虑借贷者其他Trust的债务。从而可以实现重复使用持有者的贷款额度。

## Negative Gearing
NG、负扣税是指出租房收入低于支出。比如租金1000/w，一年54K。但利息，物业费，水电费等等支出是60K。那么就是说一年要亏本6K。这样报税时候就可以把自己的年收入减去这部分，剩下的部分再报税。
从而能减少部分损失。NG跟最后卖房的CGCaptical Gain）没有关系，CG就是简单的看购买时候的支出跟卖出去的收入之间的差，这部分就是CG，加进当年的总收入来扣税。
但如果做了资产折损，那这部分也得加入到最后的Capital Gain里面。

### Negative Gearing
Negative gearing occurs when the expenses of owning a rental property (such as mortgage interest, maintenance costs, and other expenses) exceed the rental income 
generated from that property. This results in a net rental loss, which can be deducted from an investor's other income (like salary) for tax purposes. 
The primary advantage is the reduction in taxable income, leading to lower tax liabilities in the short term.

### Capital Gains
Capital gains refer to the profit made from selling an asset, such as property, for more than its purchase price. 
In Australia, capital gains on property are subject to Capital Gains Tax (CGT). However, if the property is held for more than 12 months, 
investors are eligible for a 50% discount on the capital gains tax.
### how to calculate Capital Gains
#### Calculate the Cost Base
- Purchase price
- Stamp duty on the purchase
- Legal fees
- Improvement costs (e.g., renovations)
- Selling costs (e.g., agent's commission, advertising)
- Holding costs (if not previously claimed as deductions)

Capital Gain=Sale Price−Cost Base

If the property was held for more than 12 months, individual taxpayers and some entities (like trusts) can apply a 50% discount on the capital gain. Superannuation funds are eligible for a 33.33% discount.
For individuals and trusts:
Discounted Capital Gain = Capital Gain × 0.5

#### Offset Capital Losses
If you have any capital losses (from other investments or properties), you can use these to offset the capital gain.

Net Capital Gain = Discounted Capital Gain − Capital Losses Net Capital Gain=Discounted Capital Gain−Capital Losses

#### Add the Net Capital Gain to Your Assessable Income
The net capital gain is added to your assessable income for the financial year and taxed at your marginal tax rate.

Cost Base=Purchase Price+Stamp Duty+Legal Fees (purchase)+Improvements+Agent’s Commission+Legal Fees (sale)
Capital Gain=Sale Price−Cost Base
Discounted Capital Gain=Capital Gain×0.5
Add the net capital gain to your assessable income and pay tax at your marginal rate.

## NSW TOD -Transport oriented development
rezone的31个区域。
https://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-12/transport-oriented-development-program.pdf
Land within 1,200 metres of 8 rail and metro stations will be rezoned by the NSW Government to 
allow for more new and affordable homes. These 8 stations are: 
Bankstown, Bays West, Bella Vista, Crows Nest, Homebush Hornsby, Kellyville and Macquarie 
Park. 
Part 2 of the program will focus on precincts that have existing infrastructure and are located within 
400 metres of 31 stations to create capacity for 138,000 new homes over 15 years. 
New planning controls, delivered through a new State Environment Planning Policy (SEPP) will 
enable faster delivery of more housing close to jobs and amenity. These 31 locations are: 
Adamstown station, Ashfield station, Banksia station, Berala station, Booragul station, 
Canterbury metro station, Corrimal station, Croydon station, Dapto station, Dulwich Hill station, 
Gordon station, Gosford station, Hamilton station, Killara station, Kogarah station, Kotara 
station, Lidcombe station, Lindfield station, Marrickville station, Morisset station, Newcastle 
Interchange, North Strathfield metro station, North Wollongong station, Rockdale station,
