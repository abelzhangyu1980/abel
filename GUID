A standard UUID code contains 32 hex digits along with 4 “-” symbols, which makes its length equal to 36 characters. There is also a Nil UUID code where all bits are set to zero.

GUIDs are large, enormous numbers that are nearly guaranteed to be unique. They are usually 128 bits long and look like this in hexadecimal:

30dd879c-ee2f-11db-8314-0800200c9a66

The format is a well-defined sequence of 32 hex digits grouped into chunks of 8-4-4-4-12. This gives us 2^128 or about 10^38 numbers.

128bits -> 16 bytes -> 32 hex digits.

Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits (binary digits), also known as a nibble (or nybble).[1]
For example, an 8-bit byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary form, which can be conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.

0123456789abcdef 
Hexadecimal is used in the transfer encoding Base16, in which each byte of the plaintext is broken into two 4-bit values and represented by two hexadecimal digits.

In most current use cases, the letters A–F or a–f represent the values 10–15, while the numerals 0–9 are used to represent their decimal values.

Hex Digits
1 hex digit = 4 bits = 1 nibble.
Hex	Binary	Decimal	 	Hex	Binary	Decimal
0	0000	0	 	8	1000	8
1	0001	1	 	9	1001	9
2	0010	2	 	A	1010	10
3	0011	3	 	B	1011	11
4	0100	4	 	C	1100	12
5	0101	5	 	D	1101	13
6	0110	6	 	E	1110	14
7	0111	7	 	F	1111	15

16 Different Values
There are 16 Hexadecimal digits. They are the same as the decimal digits up to 9, but then there are the letters A, B, C, D, E and F in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15:

Hexadecimal:	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	A	B	C	D	E	F
Decimal:	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12	13	14	15
So a single Hexadecimal digit can show 16 different values instead of the normal 10.

After the "Ones" position is filled up (after F) the ones start back at 0, and we add 1 to the next position on the left (to show 1 lot of 16).

And after that position reaches F, we do the same thing, and so on.

As we move left, every number place is 16 times bigger.

The Great GUID Shortage
When learning about GUIDs, it feels like 39 measly digits aren’t enough. Won’t we run out if people get GUID-crazy, assigning them for everything from their pets to their favorite bubble gum flavor?

Let’s see. Think about how big the Internet is: Google has billions of web pages in its index. Let’s call it a trillion (10^12) for kicks. Think about every wikipedia article, every news item on CNN, every product in Amazon, every blog post from any author. We can assign a GUID for each of these documents.

Now let’s say everyone on Earth gets their own copy of the internet, to keep track of their stuff. Even crazier, let’s say each person gets their own copy of the internet every second. How long can we go on?

3.1. UUID Variant
In the example above, A denotes the variant that defines the layout of the UUID. All the other bits in the UUID depend on the layout of the variant field. 
Therefore, the variant represents the three most significant bits of A:

  MSB1    MSB2    MSB3
   0       X       X     reserved (0)
   1       0       X     current variant (2)
   1       1       0     reserved for Microsoft (6)
   1       1       1     reserved for future (7)
a/A --->1010  
Above, the A value in the example UUID is “a”, which is 10xx in binary. So, the layout variant is 2.

Similarly, B represents the version. In the example UUID, the value of B is 4, which means it is using version 4.

For any UUID object inside Java, we can check the variant and the version using the .variant() and the .version() methods:

UUID uuid = UUID.randomUUID();
int variant = uuid.variant();
int version = uuid.version();

Moreover, there are five different versions for variant 2 UUIDs:

Time-Based (UUIDv1)
DCE Security (UUIDv2)
Name Based (UUIDv3 and UUIDv5)
Random (UUIDv4)

IBM P8 uses variant 2 and version 4 (random)

UUID version 1 uses the current timestamp and the MAC address of the device generating the UUID. In particular, the timestamp is measured in units of 100 nanoseconds from October 15, 1582. Still, if privacy is a concern, we can use a random 48-bit number instead of the MAC address.

Finally, we already described how to generate version 4 UUID. Again, we call the randomUUID() method the UUID class provides to get the UUIDv4.

4.1. Version 1
UUID version 1 uses the current timestamp and the MAC address of the device generating the UUID. In particular, the timestamp is measured in units of 100 nanoseconds from October 15, 1582. Still, if privacy is a concern, we can use a random 48-bit number instead of the MAC address.

With this in mind, let's generate the least significant and most significant 64 bits as long values:

private static long get64LeastSignificantBitsForVersion1() {
    Random random = new Random();
    long random63BitLong = random.nextLong() & 0x3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFL;
    long variant3BitFlag = 0x8000000000000000L;
    return random63BitLong | variant3BitFlag;
}
Copy
Above, we combine two long values representing the last 63 bits of a random long value and the 3-bit variant flag. Next, we create the 64 most significant bits using a timestamp:

private static long get64MostSignificantBitsForVersion1() {
    final long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();
    final long time_low = (currentTimeMillis & 0x0000_0000_FFFF_FFFFL) << 32; 
    final long time_mid = ((currentTimeMillis >> 32) & 0xFFFF) << 16;
    final long version = 1 << 12; 
    final long time_hi = ((currentTimeMillis >> 48) & 0x0FFF);
    return time_low | time_mid | version | time_hi;
}
Copy
We can then pass these two values to the constructor of the UUID:

public static UUID generateType1UUID() {
    long most64SigBits = get64MostSignificantBitsForVersion1();
    long least64SigBits = get64LeastSignificantBitsForVersion1();
    return new UUID(most64SigBits, least64SigBits);
}

----------------FileNet ID type 4 code ---------------------
    byte[] bytes = IdGen.getRandomBytes();
    bytes[7] = (byte)(bytes[7] & 0xF);   ----1111
    bytes[7] = (byte)(bytes[7] | 0x40);   ---10000000---
    bytes[8] = (byte)(bytes[8] & 0x3F);   --  1011001111
    bytes[8] = (byte)(bytes[8] | 0x80);
    Id newId = new Id(bytes, null);
    return newId;

0X40 is a hexadecimal (hex) number. We can tell it is a hex number because it starts with 0X. Hexadecimal numbers like 0X40 are not often used in daily life, but we see them used for certain things such as html colors, shortening binary numbers, computer error codes, and math exercises.

The hexadecimal number system has 16 symbols (base 16) instead of the decimal system which has 10 numbers (base 10). The hex symbols are 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F where A=10, B=11, C=12. D=13, E=14, and F=15.

Like we said above, the 0X indicates that it is a hex number and that is the only purpose of 0X. Thus, to convert a hex number such as 0X40 to decimal, we only need to look at the symbols after 0X which are 40.

To convert the hex number 0X40 to decimal (or any other hexadecimal number for that matter), you follow these steps:

Step 1) Multiply the last digit by 1, Multiply the second to last digit by 16, Multiply the third to the last digit by 16 x 16, Multiply the fourth to the last digit by 16 x 16 x 16, Multiply the fifth to the last digit by 16 x 16 x 16 x 16 and so on until all the digits are used.

Step 2) Add up all the products you got from Step 1 to get the answer to 0X40 in decimal.

Here is the math using using the steps above showing you how to convert 0X40 to decimal.

0 x 1 = 0
4 x 16 = 64

0 + 64 = 64

That is all there is to it. Here is the answer to 0X40 in decimal:

64
