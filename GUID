GUIDs are large, enormous numbers that are nearly guaranteed to be unique. They are usually 128 bits long and look like this in hexadecimal:

30dd879c-ee2f-11db-8314-0800200c9a66

The format is a well-defined sequence of 32 hex digits grouped into chunks of 8-4-4-4-12. This gives us 2^128 or about 10^38 numbers.

128bits -> 16 bytes -> 32 hex digits.

Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits (binary digits), also known as a nibble (or nybble).[1]
For example, an 8-bit byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary form, which can be conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.

0123456789abcdef 
Hexadecimal is used in the transfer encoding Base16, in which each byte of the plaintext is broken into two 4-bit values and represented by two hexadecimal digits.

In most current use cases, the letters A–F or a–f represent the values 10–15, while the numerals 0–9 are used to represent their decimal values.

Hex Digits
1 hex digit = 4 bits = 1 nibble.
Hex	Binary	Decimal	 	Hex	Binary	Decimal
0	0000	0	 	8	1000	8
1	0001	1	 	9	1001	9
2	0010	2	 	A	1010	10
3	0011	3	 	B	1011	11
4	0100	4	 	C	1100	12
5	0101	5	 	D	1101	13
6	0110	6	 	E	1110	14
7	0111	7	 	F	1111	15

16 Different Values
There are 16 Hexadecimal digits. They are the same as the decimal digits up to 9, but then there are the letters A, B, C, D, E and F in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15:

Hexadecimal:	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	A	B	C	D	E	F
Decimal:	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12	13	14	15
So a single Hexadecimal digit can show 16 different values instead of the normal 10.

After the "Ones" position is filled up (after F) the ones start back at 0, and we add 1 to the next position on the left (to show 1 lot of 16).

And after that position reaches F, we do the same thing, and so on.

As we move left, every number place is 16 times bigger.

The Great GUID Shortage
When learning about GUIDs, it feels like 39 measly digits aren’t enough. Won’t we run out if people get GUID-crazy, assigning them for everything from their pets to their favorite bubble gum flavor?

Let’s see. Think about how big the Internet is: Google has billions of web pages in its index. Let’s call it a trillion (10^12) for kicks. Think about every wikipedia article, every news item on CNN, every product in Amazon, every blog post from any author. We can assign a GUID for each of these documents.

Now let’s say everyone on Earth gets their own copy of the internet, to keep track of their stuff. Even crazier, let’s say each person gets their own copy of the internet every second. How long can we go on?
