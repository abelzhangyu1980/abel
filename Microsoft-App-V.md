Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) is an application virtualization client that makes an application available to end users without
installing it on a personal computer (PC). Instead, Microsoft App-V wraps each application in a virtual layer that sits between the software and the operating system (OS).
This lets applications behave as if they're traditionally installed when in fact they're being streamed from a centrally managed service or even from the end user's PC.

Microsoft App-V creates a virtual environment, called a bubble, for each application deployed by an organization. This virtual layer is wrapped around the software and isolates it from other applications and the OS. 
It also includes files, settings and other registry entries required to run the application.
