## relationships
### Lookup relationship vs master Detail
lookup is a loosely coupled relationship,allowing you to connect one object to another in a one-to-many fashion.
i.e a sales order object may be related to a store object. each sales order is related to one store and each store is related to one or more sales orders.
the sales order and store object can exist independently.
you can have a maximum of 40 lookups on an object.

master detail relationship is a strongly coupled relationship , meaning if the parent is deleted, so are the child objects.
master-detail also allows the parent record to control child record atributes such as sharing and visiblity. whichever security setting you chose
for the parent record, the child record inherits.
i.e room -> event. 
you can have a maximum of two master details on an object.

### many to many
many to many relationship allow two objects to be related to each other when a record from one object can be linked to multple records from another objects
and vice versa.
two master-detail relationships can be used to create a many-to-many relationship between two objects. a many-to-many relationship simply allow the master
record to have mutiple detail records and the detail records to have multiple master or parent records. 
ie. job position <-- job application --> candidate
