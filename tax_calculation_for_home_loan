* total home loan: 960000
* home loan rate: 6.17%(P&I)
* Minimum payment amount: $5,864.41
* available cash: 300K
* annual taxable income: 190K
** total tax to pay: 56K
* saving interest rate: 5.2%
* rental income: 36K


* If no offset:
** total to pay first year: 60K
** total interest to pay: 57K

if put 300K into offset:
** total to pay first year: 44K
** total interest to pay: 36K

which means I can save up to 21K with offset.

but as rental income is 36,080, which means it can completely cover the interest... hence I won't be able to claim any negative captical gain. 

say without offset, the loss is about 20K, if I claim negative captical gain for the 20K, meaning my taxable income will become 170K instead of 190K and the total tax i've to pay is 48K. 
which means I got 8K return for the extra paid interest 21K!!! not comparable....

if I deposit the 300K into saving account with interest rate 5%, i can only make 15K interest.and the 15K earning will be added up to my taxable income as well. which will have 45% tax...

so in summary, offset can make much more benefit than saving.
